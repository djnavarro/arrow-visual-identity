# Visual identity guidelines for Apache Arrow

> WARNING: THIS IS A DRAFT PROPOSAL ONLY. DO NOT CITE OR RELY ON THIS VERSION

As a community project, the visual identity guidelines for Apache Arrow attempt to balance the need to maintain consistent visual imagery in "formal" contexts, while allowing flexibility for fun and creative reuse of the Apache Arrow visual identity in "informal" contexts! To make this possible, there are two versions of these guidelines:

- The [formal](/formal) guidelines will usually be appropriate for official documentation, presentations, document templates, books, and so on. In general, when the context is a "serious" one, this is where you should look.
- The [informal](/informal) guidelines will usually be appropriate in more unofficial contexts. Artwork, stickers, fun side projects and so on. In general, when the context is less serious and more "fun", this is where you should look.

If you want to go straight to the files for the official Apache Arrow logos and hex stickers they are all in the [logos](/logos) folder!
