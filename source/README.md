# Source code

Contains source code to generate images in the repository. 

- Code in the [clean](\clean) subfolder generates the various logos, hexes, etc (i.e., it's code that other people might find useful!)
- Code in the [annotated](\annotated) subfolder generates the images is less useful: it's only used to generate the "annotated" images used in the README files to highlight spacing, font choices etc
